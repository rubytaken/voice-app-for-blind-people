## ABSTRACT

Accessibility in software applications represents one of the fundamental challenges in modern human-computer interaction. Visually impaired individuals face significant barriers when attempting to utilize conventional digital recording and note-taking systems that primarily rely on visual interfaces and manual interaction patterns. Traditional voice recording applications require complex visual navigation, making them impractical for users with visual disabilities. The absence of intelligent organization and retrieval mechanisms further compounds these difficulties, as users cannot efficiently locate and manage their recorded content.

This project presents the development of a comprehensive web-based voice recording system specifically engineered for visually impaired users. The system employs a voice-controlled interface powered by the Web Speech API, enabling hands-free operation through natural language commands in both English and Turkish. The application integrates Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash artificial intelligence model to provide intelligent features including automatic note naming, topic extraction, and natural language-based note retrieval. The system architecture is built upon React 19 framework with TypeScript, utilizing modern web technologies including TailwindCSS for responsive design and MediaRecorder API for high-quality audio capture. Real-time speech-to-text transcription provides immediate feedback during recording sessions, while comprehensive ARIA labeling and keyboard shortcuts ensure full compatibility with screen reader technologies.

Implementation results demonstrate superior accessibility compared to conventional recording applications. The AI-powered intelligent naming system eliminates the need for manual title assignment, while natural language search capabilities allow users to retrieve recordings through conversational queries rather than precise text matching. The multi-language voice command recognition operates simultaneously in English and Turkish, providing seamless bilingual functionality. Performance metrics indicate average response times of less than one second for AI operations, with high accuracy in command recognition and note retrieval. The system architecture is designed for future scalability, with prepared integration points for Supabase backend services to enable cloud storage, user authentication, and cross-device synchronization.

## INTRODUCTION

The field of assistive technology has emerged as a critical area of software engineering, addressing the digital divide that separates individuals with disabilities from the benefits of modern computing systems. Accessibility in software development is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement that ensures equitable access to digital services for all users regardless of their physical capabilities. Initial research into accessibility focused primarily on visual modifications such as high-contrast interfaces and screen magnification. However, these approaches proved insufficient for users with severe visual impairments who require fundamentally different interaction paradigms. The evolution of voice-controlled interfaces and speech recognition technologies has opened new possibilities for creating genuinely accessible applications that eliminate reliance on visual feedback and manual input methods.

The concept of voice-controlled applications originated from research in human-computer interaction that recognized speech as a natural and universal communication modality. Early voice recognition systems were developed in the 1950s, but practical applications remained limited until recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing. Modern speech recognition APIs, particularly the Web Speech API standardized by the W3C consortium, have made high-quality voice recognition accessible to web developers without requiring specialized infrastructure. These technologies enable the creation of applications that can be operated entirely through voice commands, providing a pathway toward truly accessible software systems. The integration of artificial intelligence further enhances these capabilities by enabling context-aware interpretation of user intent and intelligent content organization.

The objective of this project is to investigate the development of an accessible voice recording system that addresses the specific needs of visually impaired users. The system must provide comprehensive functionality for recording, storing, organizing, and retrieving audio content without requiring visual interaction or manual navigation. Key challenges include implementing reliable voice command recognition that operates in multiple languages, providing real-time feedback through audio and screen reader compatibility, ensuring intelligent organization of recorded content, and maintaining high performance despite the computational demands of speech processing and AI integration. The solution employs modern web technologies including React for component-based architecture, TypeScript for type-safe development, Web Speech API for voice recognition and transcription, MediaRecorder API for audio capture, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for artificial intelligence features.

The project report consists of five chapters that document the complete development lifecycle. Chapter One establishes the theoretical foundation by reviewing the current state of assistive technology and voice-controlled interfaces, examining existing solutions and their limitations, and defining the specific requirements for an accessible recording system. The analysis includes evaluation of Web Speech API capabilities, assessment of AI integration options, and identification of accessibility standards that must be satisfied. Chapter Two presents the system architecture and design principles, describing the component structure, state management approach, voice command processing pipeline, and AI service integration. The technical specifications for each subsystem are provided, including data flow diagrams and interface definitions.

Chapter Three focuses on the implementation of core functionality, detailing the development of voice recognition hooks, audio recording components, real-time transcription display, and multi-language support mechanisms. The integration of Google Gemini AI is explained, including the implementation of automatic note naming algorithms, topic extraction procedures, and natural language search capabilities. Technical challenges encountered during development and their solutions are documented. Chapter Four addresses accessibility compliance, describing the implementation of ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast visual design. Testing procedures with assistive technologies are presented to validate accessibility claims.

Chapter Five presents the evaluation and validation of the system through functional testing, performance analysis, and usability assessment. The results demonstrate the system's capability to provide comprehensive voice recording functionality without requiring visual interaction. AI-powered features significantly enhance usability by eliminating manual organization tasks and enabling intuitive content retrieval. The application successfully operates in both English and Turkish with seamless language switching, providing genuine bilingual accessibility. Finally, the conclusion section synthesizes the project outcomes, discusses the practical implications of the accessibility features implemented, identifies limitations of the current system, and proposes directions for future enhancement including cloud integration through Supabase backend services for cross-device synchronization and persistent storage.
